* Relevant for use cases:
  * Addition to rollback use case by testing configuration before it is pushed??? It cant replace **rollback** but is a nice-to-have basic check before pushing config to the device
  * Clusters of firewalls from different vendors: Can check whether particular rule is compatible for all relevant filters
  * 



## External libs compatible with Capirca
